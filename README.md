# RFM Analysis with SQL

This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on transportation vehicle sales data. RFM analysis is a valuable technique for segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses make data-driven marketing and sales decisions. 

## About

RFM analysis is a powerful method for understanding customer behavior by examining three key aspects:

- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
- Monetary: How much money a customer spends.

This project focuses on implementing RFM analysis using SQL queries on customer transaction data.


## Note

In addition to RFM analysis, this project also includes sales analysis bases off of the same data. The Dashboard for this project can be found on my Tableau Public Profile, found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/john.nguyen3007#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0
