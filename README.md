# RFM Analysis

## Overview
Focused on customer-centric growth, this project develops a behavioral segmentation model in MS SQL Server using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics. The technical implementation utilizes NTILE functions to score the customer base and Market Basket Analysis via XML PATH string aggregation to identify frequently co-purchased product bundles. Integrated with a dual-dashboard suite in Tableau, the project provides a 360-degree view of sales performance and customer loyalty, enabling targeted re-engagement strategies for "at-risk" segments.
