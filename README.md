# RFM Analysis with SQL

This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for conducting RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on customer data. RFM analysis is a valuable technique for segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses make data-driven marketing and sales decisions.

## About

RFM analysis is a powerful method for understanding customer behavior by examining three key aspects:

- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
- Monetary: How much money a customer spends.

This project focuses on implementing RFM analysis using SQL queries on customer transaction data.
